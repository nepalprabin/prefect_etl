SARS-CoV-2 relies on cellular RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) to replicate and spread, although which RBPs control SARS-CoV-2 infection remains largely unknown. Here, we employ a multi-omic approach to identify systematically and comprehensively which cellular and viral RBPs are involved in SARS-CoV-2 infection. We reveal that the cellular RNA-bound proteome is remodelled upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, having widespread effects on RNA metabolic pathways, non-canonical RBPs and antiviral factors. more...Organism:Homo sapiens; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2Type:Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingPlatform: GPL28867 6 SamplesFTP download: GEO (TSV) ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/series/GSE171nnn/GSE171382/SRA Run Selector: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/study/?acc=PRJNA719366SeriesAccession: GSE171382ID: 200171382"}, {"id": "200171110", "title": "Whole blood transciptome analysis in severe Covid-19  patients and healthy donors", "data": "The identification of COVID-19 patients with high-risk of severe disease is a challenge in routine care.

Moderate cases were characterized by the presence of highly clonally expanded tissue-resident CD8+ T cells. more...Organism:Homo sapiensType:Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing; OtherPlatform: GPL23227 21 SamplesFTP download: GEO (CSV, H5) ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/series/GSE145nnn/GSE145926/SRA Run Selector: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/study/?acc=PRJNA608742SeriesAccession: GSE145926ID: 200145926"}, {"id": "200147507", "title": "Transcriptional response to SARS-CoV-2 infection", "data": "Viral pandemics pose an imminent threat to humanity. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, requires the urgent development of anti-viral therapies. Because of its recent emergence, there is a paucity of information regarding viral behavior and host response following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we offer an in-depth analysis of the host response to SARS-CoV-2 as it compares to other respiratory infections. more...Organism:Mustela putorius furo; Homo sapiensType:Expression profiling by high throughput sequencingPlatforms: GPL18573 GPL28369 110 SamplesFTP download: GEO (TSV) ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/series/GSE147nnn/GSE147507/SRA Run Selector: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/study/?acc=PRJNA615032SeriesAccession: GSE147507ID: 200147507"}, {"id": "100030587", "title": "Nanostring GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling (DSP) Platform", "data": "Cancer Transcriptome Atlas Panel targets are defined in Alpha_CTA_V2.0.pkc 27 additional Covid targets are defined in GeoMx_COVID19_V1.0.pkc.
